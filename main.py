On behalf of Bulgarian swimmer **Antani Ivanov**, it challenges a decision by the Aquatics Integrity Unit (AQIU) of World Aquatics, which extended a disciplinary suspension issued by the Bulgarian Swimming Federation (BSF) to all World Aquatics competitions worldwide. The application seeks to declare the AQIU's May 23, 2024 decision null and void (or, alternatively, to annul it) on the grounds of lack of due process, violation of the right to be heard, and failure to properly assess the legality of the original BSF decision.")

The request seeks to declare null and void, or alternatively annul, the decision of the Aquatics Integrity Unit (AQIU) of World Aquatics made on May 23, 2024, which globally extended the effects of a disciplinary sanction originally imposed by the Bulgarian Swimming Federation (BSF). The petition argues that both the BSF and AQIU decisions gravely violated **Ivanov's** right to be heard and procedural safeguards, urging the Swiss civil court to intervene due to the lack of a valid arbitration clause covering such recognition actions.")
