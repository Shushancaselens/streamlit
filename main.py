The application seeks to declare the AQIU's May 23, 2024 decision null and void (or, alternatively, to annul it) on the grounds of lack of due process, violation of the right to be heard, and failure to properly assess the legality of the original BSF decision.")

The petition argues that both the BSF and AQIU decisions gravely violated **Ivanov's** right to be heard and procedural safeguards, urging the Swiss civil court to intervene due to the lack of a valid arbitration clause covering such recognition actions.")
