        "summary": "The case involves a contractual dispute between FC Volyn, a Ukrainian football club, and Issa Ndoye, a Senegalese footballer. Ndoye terminated his employment with FC Volyn in June 2011, claiming unpaid salary and contract breach, subsequently bringing a claim before FIFA's Dispute Resolution Chamber (DRC), which ruled in his favor, ordering the club to pay outstanding remuneration and compensation. FC Volyn appealed to the CAS, arguing that Ndoye had no just cause due to his alleged breaches (mainly late returns to training), while Ndoye countered that non-payment constituted just cause and sought increased compensation. Both parties debated applicable law and timing of appeals/counterclaims.",
        "court_reasoning": "The CAS panel found that FIFA regulations take precedence over national law due to the contract's terms and parties' submission to FIFA/CAS jurisdiction. The Club's repeated failure to pay Ndoye's salary for over three months was a substantial breach, constituting just cause for contract termination. Alleged late returns by Ndoye did not nullify this breach, and there was no evidence he agreed to delay payment. Counterclaims by respondents were inadmissible per CAS procedural rules. The compensation set by the FIFA DRC was appropriate.",
        "case_outcome": "The appeal by FC Volyn was dismissed and the FIFA DRC's decision was upheld: FC Volyn must pay Ndoye USD 299,200 in outstanding remuneration and USD 495,000 as compensation. Ndoye's counterclaim for additional damages was ruled inadmissible, and all other requests were dismissed. The panel confirmed that the time limit for appeal had been respected and that FIFA regulations (with Swiss law supplementary) applied.",

                "full_context": "Page 15 - 77. The concept of just cause has been extensively developed through CAS jurisprudence and FIFA regulations. The FIFA Regulations on the Status and Transfer of Players (RSTP) provide the foundational framework for determining when a party may terminate a contract.\n\nPage 15 - 78. The Commentary on the RSTP states the following with regard to the concept of 'just cause': 'The definition of just cause and whether just cause exists shall be established in accordance with the merits of each particular case. Behaviour that is in violation of the terms of an employment contract cannot justify unilateral termination by the other party if such behaviour is of minor importance.'\n\nPage 15 - 79. Furthermore, the Commentary emphasizes that just cause must be of such gravity that the injured party cannot reasonably be expected to continue the employment relationship. This standard has been consistently applied by CAS panels in determining whether contract termination was justified."

When an employer fails to meet this basic obligation, it strikes at the heart of the employment contract.\n\nPage 22 - 89. Non-payment of salary constitutes a breach of contract which may give rise to just cause for the employee to terminate the employment contract. The CAS has consistently held that when salary payments are delayed for a period exceeding two to three months, this constitutes a substantial breach sufficient to justify termination.\n\nPage 22 - 90. However, the employee must demonstrate that they have given the employer reasonable opportunity to remedy the breach and that the non-payment was not justified by any countervailing circumstances or legitimate disputes over the amount owed."

In assessing whether just cause exists, CAS panels must weigh all relevant circumstances, including the nature and severity of the breach, the conduct of both parties, and the overall context of the contractual relationship.\n\nPage 31 - 105. The consistent jurisprudence of CAS establishes that just cause must be of such severity that the injured party cannot reasonably be expected to continue the contractual relationship. This objective test requires careful analysis of whether a reasonable person in the same position would consider the breach sufficiently serious to warrant termination.\n\nPage 31 - 106. The Panel notes that minor infractions, isolated incidents, or breaches that can be readily remedied do not typically constitute just cause. The breach must fundamentally undermine the basis of the contractual relationship and make continued performance unreasonable or impossible."
